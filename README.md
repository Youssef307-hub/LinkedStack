# LinkedStack
*Linked Stack implementation using OOP principles*

**The Stack is a Last In First Out *(LIFO)* data structure used to solve various problems**

## In this project I implemented the main stack methods which are:
- **Push**: Method to push items on top of the stack.
- **Pop**: Method to pop the top item from the stack.
- **Peek**: Method to display the top  item in the stack.
- **Empty**: Method to check whether the stack is empty or not.
- **Elements**: Method to display all the items in the stack.
